1. If you increaase the generational gap for the elitist selection the algorithm becomes much faster but if you increase
it too much you will converge too early.

2. if the mutation rate is low and your stopping criteria is to find an acceptable solution you might never find one
because the population converged and is too uniform

3. The coeficients for attack and defense don't matter, there is always one that is going to be 0 with an optimal
character. For example an optimal warrior will not go for 60% attack and 40% defense but will try to get 100% attack in
order to get the best performance score.

4. the most optimal number for a variable seems to be 80-90 because after that the tanh function has diminishing returns
For example in order to get the maximum attack you need about 90 strength 80 dexterity/intelligence and 30 intelligence/dexterity.

5. most optimal height for a maximum of ATM is 1.92 and for DTM is the minimum so 1.30
